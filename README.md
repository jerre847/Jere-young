Game Concept
It is a college simulation where you make your own academic and social choices throughout a semester. You begin with starting stats (GPA, study habits, social credits, and stress) and make choices that manage these variables. Your end stats at the end decide your graduation outcome.
The game demonstrates how choices and priorities affect success, stress, and balance in college life.
???? Branching Logic
The game uses branching logic (if / elif / else, nested conditions, and logical operators) to create different story paths:
Course Load Decision (Step 2)
Choose a light, standard, or heavy load.
Nested conditions adjust study hours and stress level according to your current GPA.
Study Strategy (Step 3)
Choose a subject to focus on (validated against a list of study subjects).
Logical operators (and, or, not) ensure that you're striking a balance between school and society.
Final Assessment (Step 4)
Option to view your final numbers at graduation.
Identity operators (is, is not) and nested if-statements validate data types and inputs.
Multiple Endings
Honors & Dream Job → High GPA with minimal stress.
Successful Graduation → Good GPA with consistent effort.
Burnout/Struggle → High stress or poor social equilibrium.
Average Results → Everything else.
